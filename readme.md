## Problem Statement
A client is building an e-commerce mobile application for their line of coffee machines and custom coffee pods; they are looking to have two
screens: one screen to display coffee machines and one screen to display coffee pods. On the coffee machines screen, the user may filter by
product type and water line. On the coffee pods screen, the user may filter by product type, coffee flavor, and pack size. Your task is to simulate
this environment and build an API to return the data for these two screens.
